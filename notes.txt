-I am having an issue with project 2, it does not compile and simulate even though I did everything in the lab
-Now it works and I have absolutely no idea what I did to make it work. I just followed the directions and checked everything and this time it began compiling.
-Never mind, it just started compiling because I included inet4.5 in the project

I think I fixed it!! I changed "import NetworkObjects.computer" to "import networkobjects.Computer;" in the ComputerNetwork.ned file and the error is gone!

The simulation completely worked after making that change
